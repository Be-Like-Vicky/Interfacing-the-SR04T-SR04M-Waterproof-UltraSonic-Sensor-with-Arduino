Adding cameras and vision algorithms to your projects and robots might sound cool but sometimes it becomes expensive in terms of both capital and time. When the task at hand is much simpler like obstacle detection, distance measurement, or depth monitoring, ultrasonic sensors are a great alternate to place your bets on. Not only are these sensors fast and accurate but some of their variants like the SR04T and the SR04M also come in waterproof packages making them durable in harsh weather conditions and even underwater applications. This makes them a developerâ€™s first choice as they offer a wide variety of features and easily surpass the more common HC-SR04 sensor in terms of functionality.

The following article shows you how to interface the SR04T Waterproof Ultrasonic sensor with an Arduino Uno to obtain distance data. The article also discusses the working of the module along with a detailed explanation of the code required to process the data into a usable format.
